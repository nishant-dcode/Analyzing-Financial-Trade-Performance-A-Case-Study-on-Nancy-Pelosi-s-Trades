Project Summary: Trade Performance Analysis and Evaluation
This project involves developing a Python function to calculate the trade performance of a given set of trades executed by a financial firm. 
The function computes key financial metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of trading strategies, including both long and short positions.
The project also includes analyzing real-world trading data, specifically trades reportedly made by Nancy Pelosi, to demonstrate the function's application and interpret the results.
